Project Background: Children’s Hospital Colorado is ranked within the top 10 children’s hospitals in the U.S. by U.S. News and World Report and as a result it’s at the cutting edge in delivering clinical care, education, and research in the pediatric healthcare arena. The goal of this project was to create a computer graphics based simulation to improve the ability of healthcare professionals (nurses, respiratory therapists, and physicians) to manage these emergencies.


Approach: A graphics based tracheostomy training simulator developed for the healthcare professionals of Children’s Hospital Colorado in the Otolaryngology department. The development process began with creating a logical decision tree with the guidance of pediatric surgeons from the hospital. We closely collaborated with the hospital’s in-house animator to obtain realistic graphics and animations for the simulation. We used Unity, a cross platform game engine, to carry out the implementation of the simulation.
